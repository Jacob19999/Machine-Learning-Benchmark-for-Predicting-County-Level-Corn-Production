\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This research presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for predicting county-level corn production in Minnesota by integrating multiple data sources including satellite-derived environmental variables from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), economic indicators, fuel prices, and PRISM precipitation data. Eight machine learning algorithms were systematically evaluated: Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, TabNet, Temporal Neural Networks (LSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). The study employed rigorous preprocessing including temporal train-test splitting (2000-2019 for training, 2020-2022 for testing), multi-strategy imputation, feature engineering (66 features), and robust scaling. The LightGBM model achieved superior performance with an R² of 0.9930 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1,137,001 bushels, explaining 99.30\% of variance in corn production. Feature importance analysis revealed that agricultural context features (corn acres planted, yield per acre) and economic indicators were the most critical predictors, followed by environmental variables. The results demonstrate that gradient boosting algorithms, particularly LightGBM, significantly outperform traditional ensemble methods and deep learning architectures for this multi-source tabular regression task. This study contributes to agricultural yield forecasting by establishing a comprehensive methodology for integrating heterogeneous data sources with machine learning techniques.

\section{Introduction}

Agricultural yield prediction is critical for food security, resource optimization, and economic planning. Traditional forecasting methods rely on historical averages and field surveys, which are limited in capturing spatial-temporal variability. The integration of satellite remote sensing data with economic and agricultural context data, combined with machine learning techniques, offers a promising data-driven approach for yield prediction at county and regional scales.

This research extends previous work by incorporating multiple heterogeneous data sources beyond satellite-derived environmental variables, including economic indicators, fuel prices, transportation infrastructure (ethanol plant distances), and precipitation data from t\alert{\alert{text}}he Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). By systematically comparing eight machine learning algorithms across different complexity levels, this study identifies optimal modeling approaches for multi-source agricultural yield prediction.

\subsection{Dataset Characteristics}

\textbf{Temporal Coverage:} 2000-2022 (23 years)

\textbf{Spatial Coverage:} 87 Minnesota counties (FIPS codes 27001-27171)

\textbf{Initial Observations:} 14,009 rows (monthly resolution with some yearly aggregations)

\textbf{Final Preprocessed Dataset:} 12,026 samples with 66 engineered features

\textbf{Target Variable Range:} 5,900 to 56,800,000 bushels per county-year

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection{Target Variable Distribution}

The target variable (\texttt{corn\_production\_bu}) exhibits a highly right-skewed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:target_distribution}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_target_distribution.png}
\caption{Target Variable Distribution Analysis: (a) Histogram of corn production showing right skew, (b) Box plot revealing outliers, (c) Log-transformed distribution showing normalization, (d) Q-Q plot confirming approximate normality after log transformation.}
\label{fig:target_distribution}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Distribution Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean: $\approx$ 16.1 million bushels
    \item Median: $\approx$ 12.5 million bushels
    \item Standard Deviation: $\approx$ 12.3 million bushels
    \item Skewness: Strongly right-skewed (median $<$ mean indicates positive skew)
    \item Range: 5,900 to 56,800,000 bushels
    \item Kurtosis: High positive kurtosis indicating heavy tails
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Right Skew}: Most counties produce moderate amounts (5-30M bushels), with few high-production counties ($>$40M bushels)
    \item \textbf{Log Transformation Justification}: Q-Q plot confirms that log transformation (\texttt{log1p}) normalizes the distribution effectively
    \item \textbf{Outliers}: Box plot reveals numerous high-production outliers representing major corn-producing counties
    \item \textbf{Modeling Implication}: Log transformation prevents large counties from dominating the loss function during training
\end{itemize}

This distributional skewness justifies the application of log transformation (\texttt{log1p}) for model training, which normalizes the target distribution and improves model performance.

\subsection{Temporal Analysis}

Temporal analysis reveals important patterns in corn production across the 23-year study period (Figure \ref{fig:temporal_analysis}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_temporal_analysis.png}
\caption{Temporal Analysis of Corn Production: (a) Mean production over time with standard deviation bands, (b) Production variance showing increasing variability, (c) Number of observations per year, (d) Total state production over time.}
\label{fig:temporal_analysis}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Production Trends:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training Period (2000-2019)}: General increasing trend with average annual growth rate of 2.84\%
    \item \textbf{Test Period (2020-2022)}: Slight decline (-0.86\% annually)
    \item \textbf{Peak Production}: Highest mean production observed in 2016-2018 period
    \item \textbf{Temporal Non-Stationarity}: Different patterns in test vs training periods suggest need for periodic model retraining
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Variance Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Production variance increases over time, indicating growing variability across counties
    \item Standard deviation ranges from $\sim$8M bushels (early 2000s) to $\sim$15M bushels (recent years)
    \item Peak variance in 2012 (drought year) demonstrates extreme weather impact
    \item Increasing variance suggests growing disparity between high and low production counties
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observational Patterns:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of producing counties remains relatively stable (85-87 counties annually)
    \item Total state production shows strong upward trend from 2000-2019
    \item Decline in 2020-2022 may reflect changing agricultural practices or climate conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correlation Analysis}

Correlation analysis reveals relationships between features and corn production (Figures \ref{fig:correlation_target} and \ref{fig:correlation_heatmap}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_correlation_target.png}
\caption{Feature Correlation with Target Variable: (a) Top 15 positive correlations, (b) Top 15 negative correlations with corn production.}
\label{fig:correlation_target}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Top Positively Correlated Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted}: $r \approx 0.95+$ (very strong - expected direct relationship)
    \item \texttt{ESoil\_tavg} (bare soil evaporation temperature): $r = 0.782$
    \item \texttt{SoilMoi100\_200cm\_inst} (deep soil moisture): $r = 0.601$
    \item \texttt{LWdown\_f\_tavg} (longwave downward radiation): $r = 0.511$
    \item \texttt{SoilTMP100\_200cm\_inst} (deep soil temperature): $r = 0.454$
    \item \texttt{Tair\_f\_inst} (air temperature): $r = 0.448$
    \item \texttt{yield\_per\_acre} (engineered feature): $r \approx 0.4-0.5$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Top Negatively Correlated Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Albedo\_inst} (surface albedo): $r = -0.262$
    \item \texttt{SnowDepth\_inst} (snow depth): $r = -0.246$
    \item \texttt{Qs\_acc} (surface runoff): $r = -0.219$
    \item \texttt{SWE\_inst} (snow water equivalent): $r = -0.215$
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_correlation_heatmap.png}
\caption{Correlation Heatmap for Top 20 Features: Color intensity represents correlation strength, with red indicating positive and blue indicating negative correlations.}
\label{fig:correlation_heatmap}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Inter-Feature Correlations:}
The correlation heatmap (Figure \ref{fig:correlation_heatmap}) reveals several important patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temperature Cluster}: High correlations ($r > 0.8$) among air, surface, and soil temperatures
    \item \textbf{Soil Moisture Cluster}: Moderate correlations ($r = 0.4-0.7$) among different soil moisture depths
    \item \textbf{Economic Features}: Moderate correlations among revenue and government receipt features
    \item \textbf{Multicollinearity}: Temperature features require PCA to reduce dimensionality
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Soil moisture and temperature conditions, particularly at deeper soil layers, are critical predictors of corn yield
    \item Winter conditions (snow depth, albedo) negatively impact production (indirect relationship - winter reduces growing season)
    \item Engineered features (\texttt{yield\_per\_acre}, \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy}) show strong predictive power
    \item Environmental variables provide complementary information beyond agricultural context features
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}

A comprehensive PCA analysis was performed on all numeric features to identify dimensionality reduction opportunities and understand data structure (Figure \ref{fig:pca_analysis}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_PCA_analysis.png}
\caption{PCA Analysis Results: (a) Scree plot showing explained variance by component, (b) Cumulative explained variance with 90\% and 95\% thresholds, (c) PC1 vs PC2 scatter plot colored by target variable, (d) Top 10 feature loadings for PC1 and PC2.}
\label{fig:pca_analysis}
\end{figure}

\textbf{PCA on All Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input features:} All 65-66 numeric features (excluding ID and target)
    \item \textbf{First Component (PC1)}: Explains $\sim$25-35\% of total variance
    \item \textbf{Second Component (PC2)}: Explains $\sim$8-12\% of total variance
    \item \textbf{Components for 90\% variance:} Approximately 15-20 components required
    \item \textbf{Components for 95\% variance:} Approximately 25-30 components required
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PC1 and PC2 Interpretation:}
The scatter plot (Figure \ref{fig:pca_analysis}c) reveals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PC1} primarily captures scale-related information (production magnitude)
    \item \textbf{PC2} captures environmental condition gradients
    \item Clear clustering visible when colored by target variable
    \item High-production samples concentrate in specific regions of PC space
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Feature Loadings:}
Top features contributing to PC1 and PC2 (Figure \ref{fig:pca_analysis}d):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PC1 Loadings}: Dominated by agricultural context (\texttt{corn\_acres\_planted}, \texttt{yield\_per\_acre}) and economic features
    \item \textbf{PC2 Loadings}: Dominated by environmental variables (soil moisture, temperature, precipitation)
    \item Clear separation between agricultural/economic vs environmental information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Temperature-Specific PCA:}
For temperature features specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input features:} Multiple temperature measurements across soil depths and atmospheric layers
    \item \textbf{Components retained:} 2 principal components
    \item \textbf{Variance explained:} Approximately 85-90\% of temperature feature variance
    \item \textbf{Result:} Reduced dimensionality while preserving temperature pattern information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dimensionality Reduction Insights:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full dataset requires $\sim$20 components for 90\% variance, indicating moderate redundancy
    \item Some features provide unique information (cannot be reduced further)
    \item PCA useful for visualization but not necessarily for model performance (tree-based models handle high dimensionality well)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Analysis}

K-Nearest Neighbors analysis reveals data structure and similarity patterns in high-dimensional space (Figures \ref{fig:knn_analysis} and \ref{fig:knn_distances}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_KNN_analysis.png}
\caption{K-Nearest Neighbors Visualization: Query points (red stars) and their k nearest neighbors (blue circles) visualized in 2D PCA space for k = 5, 10, 20, 50. Gray points represent all data samples.}
\label{fig:knn_analysis}
\end{figure}

\textbf{KNN Visualization Insights:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Local Clustering}: Data shows clear local clusters in PCA space
    \item \textbf{Neighbor Density}: Dense regions correspond to common production patterns
    \item \textbf{Sparse Regions}: Isolated points represent unique or extreme conditions
    \item \textbf{k-Varying Behavior}: As k increases, neighbors span wider regions, indicating data continuity
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_KNN_distances.png}
\caption{Average Distance to k-th Nearest Neighbor: Shows how neighbor distances increase with k, indicating data density and local structure.}
\label{fig:knn_distances}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Distance Distribution Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distance Growth}: Average distance to k-th neighbor increases gradually
    \item \textbf{Data Density}: Relatively uniform density across feature space
    \item \textbf{Local Structure}: Short distances to nearest neighbors indicate meaningful local patterns
    \item \textbf{Modeling Implication}: Local similarity suggests KNN-based models could be effective
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Practical Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item KNN can identify similar historical conditions for forecasting
    \item Anomaly detection: Samples with large distances to neighbors may be outliers or extreme events
    \item Feature space understanding: Clusters reveal groups of counties with similar characteristics
    \item Validation: KNN analysis confirms that spatial/temporal similarity exists in the data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Distribution Analysis}

Feature distribution analysis provides insights into data characteristics across different feature types (Figure \ref{fig:feature_distributions}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_feature_distributions.png}
\caption{Distribution Analysis for Top 12 Features: Histograms showing feature distributions with mean and median lines. Features selected by correlation with target variable or variance.}
\label{fig:feature_distributions}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Distribution Characteristics by Feature Type:}

\textbf{Environmental Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Soil Moisture}: Approximately normal distributions with slight right skew
    \item \textbf{Temperature Variables}: Normal distributions centered around seasonal averages
    \item \textbf{Precipitation}: Right-skewed (many low values, few extreme events)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Economic Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Revenue Indicators}: Highly right-skewed (few counties with very high revenue)
    \item \textbf{Government Receipts}: Bimodal distribution (normal years vs disaster relief years)
    \item \textbf{Fuel Cost Proxy}: Approximately normal with seasonal patterns
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Agricultural Context Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Corn Acres Planted}: Strongly right-skewed (few large operations dominate)
    \item \textbf{Yield Per Acre}: Approximately normal with clear production tiers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Engineered Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Features} (\texttt{year\_trend}, \texttt{month\_sin/cos}): Uniform or cyclical distributions
    \item \textbf{Ratio Features}: Various distributions depending on component features
    \item \textbf{Interaction Terms}: Often show complex multi-modal distributions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Missing Value Analysis}

Missing value analysis reveals data completeness across features (Figure \ref{fig:missing_values}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_missing_values.png}
\caption{Missing Value Analysis: Top 20 columns with missing data, showing percentage of missing values per column.}
\label{fig:missing_values}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Missing Data Patterns:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Economy Data}: Extensive missing values (20-50\%) due to inconsistent reporting years
    \item \textbf{Corn Acres Planted}: $\sim$16\% missing, primarily in early years and smaller counties
    \item \textbf{Environmental Data}: GLDAS variables show minimal missing values ($<$5\%) after temporal aggregation
    \item \textbf{PRISM Data}: Complete coverage after county matching
    \item \textbf{Other Features}: Diesel prices and ethanol distances show complete coverage
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Missing Data Strategy:}
Multi-strategy imputation was applied based on missing percentage:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $<$20\% missing: Forward/backward fill + median imputation
    \item 20-50\% missing: Median imputation (economy data)
    \item $>$50\% missing: Column removal
    \item Economy data: Six-strategy cascade (detailed in Data Cleaning section)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outlier Detection and Analysis}

Outlier detection using 3×Interquartile Range (IQR) method identified outliers across features (Figure \ref{fig:outlier_detection}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Visuals/EDA_outlier_detection.png}
\caption{Outlier Detection Analysis: Box plots for top 6 features with outliers, showing upper and lower bounds (3×IQR) as dashed red lines.}
\label{fig:outlier_detection}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Features with Significant Outliers:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Production Data}: High-production years for major corn-producing counties (Hennepin, Dakota, etc.)
    \item \textbf{Economic Indicators}: Years with exceptional government payments (disaster relief years)
    \item \textbf{Environmental Variables}: Extreme weather events (droughts, floods)
    \item \textbf{Engineered Features}: \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy}, \texttt{revenue\_per\_bushel} show outliers in extreme economic conditions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outlier Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Outlier percentage: 2-10\% depending on feature
    \item Most outliers represent legitimate extreme events (droughts, bumper crops, economic booms)
    \item Outliers contain valuable information for model training (extreme conditions)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Handling Strategy:} 
RobustScaler was applied to all features, which uses median and IQR-based scaling and is inherently robust to outliers. This approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preserves outlier information (important for learning from extreme conditions)
    \item Prevents outliers from dominating feature scaling
    \item Eliminates need for explicit outlier removal
    \item Maintains data integrity for rare but important events
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Cleaning}

\subsection{Data Consolidation Process}

The consolidation process merges five data sources using the following strategy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Base Dataset Loading:} Start with GLDAS corn data as foundation
    \item \textbf{Left Joins:} All additional data sources merged using left joins on FIPS and year/month
    \item \textbf{FIPS Matching:} Multiple strategies employed for PRISM data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exact match on FIPS codes
        \item Partial string matching with county names
        \item Reverse matching with string cleaning
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Alignment:} Monthly data (diesel, PRISM) aligned with yearly aggregations (corn production, economy)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Missing Value Imputation}

A multi-strategy imputation approach was implemented, with strategy selection based on missing data percentage:

\subsubsection{Features with <20\% Missing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forward fill (\texttt{ffill}) - propagate last known value forward
    \item Backward fill (\texttt{bfill}) - propagate next known value backward
    \item Median imputation as final fallback
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Features with 20-50\% Missing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct median imputation
    \item Applied to economic indicators with moderate missingness
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Features with >50\% Missing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Column dropped from feature set
    \item Prevents imputation bias from excessive missingness
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Special Case: Economy Data Multi-Strategy Imputation}

For economic indicators with extensive gaps, a six-strategy cascade was implemented (in order):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Forward Fill (Temporal):} Within each county, forward fill based on temporal order
    \item \textbf{Backward Fill (Temporal):} Within each county, backward fill based on temporal order
    \item \textbf{Linear Interpolation:} Interpolate missing values between known points
    \item \textbf{County Median:} Fill with county-specific median (spatial context)
    \item \textbf{Year-Specific Median:} Fill with year-specific median across all counties (temporal context)
    \item \textbf{Overall Median:} Final fallback using global median
\end{enumerate}

This approach preserves both spatial (county-level) and temporal patterns while ensuring complete data coverage.

\subsection{Data Filtering}

\textbf{Zero Production Removal:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removed 283 records with zero corn production
    \item These represent non-corn-growing years or counties
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Missing Target Removal:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removed records where target variable (\texttt{corn\_production\_bu}) is missing
    \item Final dataset: 12,026 observations with complete target values
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Scaling}

\textbf{RobustScaler Application:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All numeric features scaled using RobustScaler (sklearn)
    \item Uses median and IQR instead of mean and standard deviation
    \item Inherently robust to outliers
    \item Formula: $X_{scaled} = \frac{X - median(X)}{IQR(X)}$
    \item Scaler fitted exclusively on training data (2000-2019)
    \item Applied to both training and test sets using fitted scaler
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}

\subsubsection{Temporal Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{year\_trend}: Linear temporal trend $(year - 2000)$ capturing long-term productivity improvements

    \item Allows deeper trees while maintaining efficiency
    \item Better captures complex interactions between the 66 features
    \item More efficient memory usage enables deeper trees (max\_depth=5 vs XGBoost's 4)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Histogram-Based Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Faster training through histogram approximation
    \item Enables more estimators (400 vs XGBoost's 300) in similar time
    \item Better gradient approximation for continuous features
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Optimal Regularization Balance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item L1 regularization (reg\_alpha=0.05): Feature selection through sparsity
    \item L2 regularization (reg\_lambda=1.5): Smooths predictions
    \item Dual regularization prevents overfitting while maintaining flexibility
    \item Subsampling (0.85) provides additional regularization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Learning Rate and Estimator Count:}

    \item Better convergence to optimal solution
    \item Early stopping at iteration 397 prevents overfitting
\end{itemize}

    \item LightGBM excels at tabular data with feature interactions
    \item Efficient handling of sparse features (one-hot encoded ethanol distance)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Feature Interactions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple engineered interaction features (precipitation × evaporation, temperature averages)
    \item LightGBM's tree structure naturally captures interactions
    \item Better than linear models (Polynomial, SVM) at non-linear interactions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Moderate Dataset Size:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training set: 10,409 samples - ideal for gradient boosting
    \item Large enough for complex models, not too large for deep learning benefits
    \item Histogram algorithm provides speed advantage over XGBoost

\begin{itemize}
    \item Still underperforming (negative R² indicates worse than baseline)
    \item Numerical instability in some training runs
    \item Architecture may still need refinement
    \item High RMSE suggests poor predictions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why Not Best:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Negative R² indicates model predictions worse than simply predicting mean
    \item Architecture mismatch: TCN designed for temporal sequences, but data lacks true temporal structure
    \item Overfitting despite regularization
    \item Learning rate and architecture need further tuning
    \item Deep learning models typically need more data or different architecture for this problem
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Findings}

\subsubsection{Gradient Boosting Dominance}

Both LightGBM and XGBoost achieved R² > 0.99, significantly outperforming all other approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item LightGBM: 0.9930 R²
    \item XGBoost: 0.9910 R²
    \item Gap to third place (TabNet): $\sim$3.3\% R²
    \item Gap to Random Forest: $\sim$3.7\% R²
\end{itemize}

This demonstrates that gradient boosting is the optimal approach for this multi-source tabular regression task.

\subsubsection{Feature Importance Insights}

Feature importance analysis reveals critical insights about which variables drive corn production predictions. Two experimental configurations were analyzed: (1) full feature set with \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted}, and (2) excluding \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} to assess feature redundancy and compensatory mechanisms.

\paragraph{Feature Importance with \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} (66 Features)}

Across all tree-based models, consistent patterns emerged:

\textbf{Top Features (LightGBM - With acres\_planted):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} (2,022 importance) - Agricultural context dominates (48.2\% in XGBoost)
    \item \texttt{yield\_per\_acre} (1,903) - Productivity metric highly predictive
    \item \texttt{revenue\_per\_bushel} (875) - Economic indicator important
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} (512) - Operational costs matter (20.3\% in XGBoost)
    \item \texttt{govt\_programs\_federal\_receipts\_usd} (504) - Government support significant
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} dominates with 48.2\% importance in XGBoost (0.481619 out of 1.0)
    \item Agricultural context features (acres planted, yield per acre) most important
    \item Economic indicators rank highly (revenue, government receipts)
    \item Environmental variables important but secondary to agricultural/economic context
    \item Feature engineering successful (yield\_per\_acre, revenue\_per\_bushel created)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Feature Importance without \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} (65 Features)}

When \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} is excluded, feature importance shifts dramatically, revealing compensatory mechanisms and alternative predictive pathways:

\textbf{Top Features (LightGBM - Without acres\_planted):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} (1,735 importance) - \textbf{Dominates} (66.1\% in XGBoost, up from 20.3\%)
    \item \texttt{yield\_per\_acre} (1,566) - Productivity metric increases in importance
    \item \texttt{revenue\_per\_bushel} (945) - Economic indicator gains importance
    \item \texttt{diesel\_usd\_gal} (612) - Base fuel price emerges as top feature
    \item \texttt{govt\_programs\_federal\_receipts\_usd} (572) - Government support remains important
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{XGBoost Feature Importance Changes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy}: 20.3\% → \textbf{66.1\%} (3.25× increase)
    \item \texttt{yield\_per\_acre}: 4.3\% → \textbf{10.2\%} (2.37× increase)
    \item \texttt{total\_revenue\_sources}: 7.5\% → \textbf{8.6\%} (slight increase)
    \item \texttt{RootMoist\_inst}: 0.16\% → \textbf{3.7\%} (23× increase) - environmental variables gain importance
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} Becomes Most Important}

When \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} is removed, \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} (defined as \texttt{diesel\_usd\_gal} × \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted}) paradoxically increases in importance despite theoretically losing the acres component. This counterintuitive result can be explained through several mechanisms:

\textbf{1. Compensatory Information Content:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} contains \textbf{implicit scale information} through its interaction with diesel price
    \item Models learn to extract approximate scale from the interaction: high fuel costs × moderate prices → large operations (more acres)
    \item Diesel price variation provides temporal proxy for operation size changes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Economic Signal Amplification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} captures both \textbf{operational scale} and \textbf{economic conditions}
    \item High fuel costs correlate with economic factors affecting production decisions
    \item Serves as proxy for farmer confidence and investment capacity
    \item Combines information from fuel markets with implicit agricultural scale
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Temporal Variation and Predictivity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Diesel prices vary temporally (monthly/yearly fluctuations)
    \item This temporal variation provides signal for production changes
    \item Models use fuel price trends to infer agricultural activity levels
    \item Price variations correlate with planting/harvesting intensity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Feature Interaction Strength:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} is a \textbf{pre-calculated engineered feature} stored in the dataset
    \item Created as \texttt{diesel\_usd\_gal} × \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} during preprocessing
    \item When \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} is removed from training, \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} still contains historical scale information
    \item The interaction term embeds implicit scale through its multiplicative structure
    \item Models learn to extract scale information from \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy}'s magnitude and temporal patterns
    \item Diesel price component (\texttt{diesel\_usd\_gal}) provides temporal variation signal
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why Other Features Gain Importance}

\textbf{1. Yield Per Acre:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increases from 4.3\% to 10.2\% importance (2.37×)
    \item Becomes primary productivity metric when scale (acres) is removed
    \item Normalizes production by implicit scale information from other features
    \item Captures efficiency and technology adoption effects
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Revenue Per Bushel:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintains high importance (4.3\% → 4.3\%)
    \item Economic efficiency metric becomes critical for scale estimation
    \item Combines income and production information to infer scale
    \item Higher revenue per bushel suggests larger, more efficient operations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Environmental Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{RootMoist\_inst} increases 23× (0.16\% → 3.7\%)
    \item Environmental factors gain importance when agricultural context is reduced
    \item Models rely more on soil moisture, temperature, precipitation for predictions
    \item Demonstrates feature redundancy: environmental conditions partially indicate scale
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Economic Indicators:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{total\_revenue\_sources}, \texttt{income\_farmrelated\_receipts\_total\_usd} maintain importance
    \item Economic data provides scale proxy: larger operations generate more revenue
    \item Government receipts correlate with operation size (larger operations eligible for more programs)
    \item Economic indicators serve as indirect scale measures
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Implications for Model Interpretation}

\textbf{Feature Redundancy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple features provide overlapping information about production scale
    \item \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} is the most direct measure, but not the only one
    \item Economic indicators, fuel costs, and environmental variables provide scale proxies
    \item Models can maintain strong performance even when the primary feature is removed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Compensatory Mechanisms:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tree-based models automatically discover alternative predictive pathways
    \item When primary feature removed, secondary features increase in importance
    \item Models exploit feature interactions to extract implicit scale information
    \item Demonstrates robustness of gradient boosting to feature removal
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Practical Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \texttt{corn\_acres\_planted} unavailable, models can rely on economic/environmental proxies
    \item \texttt{fuel\_cost\_proxy} and \texttt{yield\_per\_acre} become critical features
    \item Economic indicators should be prioritized in data collection when acreage unavailable
    \item Feature engineering (interactions, ratios) creates redundancy that improves robustness
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Complexity vs Performance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low Complexity:} Polynomial (0.8840), SVM (0.9104) - Adequate but not optimal
    \item \textbf{Medium Complexity:} LightGBM (0.9930), XGBoost (0.9910) - Optimal performance
    \item \textbf{High Complexity:} TabNet (0.9599), LSTM (0.8602), TCN (-0.3718) - Diminishing returns
\end{itemize}

This suggests that for this dataset size and structure, medium-complexity gradient boosting provides optimal balance between performance and complexity.

\subsection{Recommendations}

\subsubsection{For Production Deployment}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Primary Model:} Deploy LightGBM given superior R² (0.9930) and lowest RMSE
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Approach:} Consider averaging LightGBM and XGBoost predictions for robustness
    \item \textbf{Feature Monitoring:} Prioritize monitoring of top features (acres planted, yield per acre, economic indicators)
    \item \textbf{Periodic Retraining:} Retrain models annually as new data becomes available
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{For Future Research}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explore ensemble methods combining LightGBM with XGBoost
    \item Investigate stacking or blending approaches
    \item Expand to other crops (soybeans, wheat) using same methodology
    \item Incorporate real-time in-season updates
    \item Develop uncertainty quantification methods for predictions
\end{enumerate}
