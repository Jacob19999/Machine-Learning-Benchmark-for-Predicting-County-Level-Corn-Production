## 📝 Methodology

### Data Integration Approach
1. **Base Dataset**: GLDAS corn production data (fips, year, month, features)
2. **Feature Addition**: Merge additional features by FIPS and year/month using left joins
3. **Data Sources**: Five primary sources integrated:
   - GLDAS satellite-derived environmental variables
   - USDA corn harvest and planted acres data
   - Economic indicators from USDA Economic Research Service
   - Diesel fuel prices (monthly)
   - PRISM precipitation and temperature data
4. **Temporal Aggregation**: Monthly to yearly aggregation where appropriate
5. **Missing Data**: Multi-strategy imputation (forward-fill, backward-fill, interpolation, median imputation)

### Feature Engineering
Created **66 informative features** across multiple categories:
- **Temporal**: Year trend, cyclical month encoding (sine/cosine)
- **Soil**: Average moisture, moisture gradient
- **Temperature**: Average, range, PCA components
- **Water Balance**: Precipitation-evaporation balance, efficiency metrics
- **Agricultural Context**: Yield per acre, fuel cost proxy
- **Economic**: Revenue sources, revenue per bushel
- **Spatial**: Ethanol plant distance categories

### Model Selection Strategy
1. **Simple Models**: Polynomial Regression, Random Forest (baseline performance)
2. **Medium Complexity**: SVM (nonlinear pattern capture)
3. **Complex Models**: XGBoost, LightGBM, TabNet, LSTM, TCN (state-of-the-art approaches)

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **RandomizedSearchCV**: Efficient sampling of parameter space (15-25 iterations)
- **GridSearchCV**: Exhaustive search for fine-tuning (reduced space for speed)
- **Cross-Validation**: 3-fold CV for most models
- **Early Stopping**: Applied for gradient boosting and deep learning models

### Data Preprocessing
- **Target Transformation**: Log transformation (log1p) to handle right-skewed distribution
- **Feature Scaling**: RobustScaler (median and IQR-based, robust to outliers)
- **Missing Value Handling**: Multi-strategy imputation with temporal and spatial context
- **Outlier Handling**: RobustScaler inherently handles outliers while preserving information

## 🛡️ Data Leakage Prevention

### What is Data Leakage?

Data leakage occurs when information from the future or test set inadvertently influences model training, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates that don't generalize to new data. This is a critical issue that can invalidate research findings.

### Types of Data Leakage Prevented

#### 1. **Temporal Data Leakage**
- **Risk**: Using future information to predict past values
- **Prevention**: 
  - **Temporal Train-Test Split**: Data split by time period (2000-2019 for training, 2020-2022 for testing)
  - No future data is used to predict past years
  - Economic data imputation only uses historical values (forward-fill, not backward-fill from future)

#### 2. **Preprocessing Data Leakage**
- **Risk**: Computing statistics (mean, median, std) on entire dataset before splitting
- **Prevention**:
  - **Scaler Fitting**: `StandardScaler` is fit exclusively on training data
    ```python
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # Fit on train only
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)        # Transform test using train stats
    ```
  - **Imputation**: `SimpleImputer` fit on training data only
    ```python
    imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
    X_train_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)  # Learn median from train
    X_test_imputed = imputer.transform(X_test)        # Use train median on test
    ```

#### 3. **Target Leakage**
- **Risk**: Using target-derived features that wouldn't be available at prediction time
- **Prevention**:
  - **Feature Selection**: Only use predictive features, not production-derived metrics
  - **Acres Planted**: Used as feature (available at planting time), not acres harvested
  - **No Future Production Data**: Production data from future years never influences training

#### 4. **Cross-Validation Data Leakage**
- **Risk**: Information leaking across CV folds
- **Prevention**:
  - **Scikit-learn Pipeline**: Ensures preprocessing is refit for each fold
  - **Temporal CV**: When using time-based CV, ensures no future data in training folds
  - **GridSearchCV**: Automatically handles proper splitting within each fold

#### 5. **Feature Engineering Leakage**
- **Risk**: Creating features using test set information
- **Prevention**:
  - All feature engineering (polynomial features, interactions) done on training set
  - Transformers fit on training, applied to test:
    ```python
    poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)
    X_train_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(X_train_scaled)  # Fit on train
    X_test_poly = poly_features.transform(X_test_scaled)        # Apply to test
    ```

### Specific Prevention Measures in This Project

#### Data Consolidation Phase (`consolidate_data_phase3.py`)
- ✅ **No Target Information**: Only uses predictive features (acres planted, not production)
- ✅ **Temporal Ordering**: Economic data imputation respects temporal order (forward-fill)
- ✅ **Separate Processing**: Each data source processed independently before merging

#### Preprocessing Phase (`preprocess_phase3_data.py`)
- ✅ **Train-Test Split First**: Data split before any preprocessing
- ✅ **Separate Scalers**: Each preprocessing step fit on training only
- ✅ **No Test Statistics**: Test set never used to compute normalization parameters

#### Model Training Phase (`model_benchmarking.py`, `SatelliteDataNew.ipynb`)
- ✅ **Strict Temporal Split**: 
  - Training: Years 2000-2019
  - Testing: Years 2020-2022
- ✅ **Independent Scaling**: Test data scaled using training statistics only
- ✅ **Cross-Validation**: CV folds respect temporal order (no time shuffling)
- ✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV ensures no leakage across CV folds

#### Feature Selection
- ✅ **Only Predictive Features**: Features available at prediction time
  - ✅ Acres planted (known at planting)
  - ✅ Environmental variables (historical/current)
  - ✅ Economic indicators (historical, forward-filled)
  - ❌ Production data (target variable)
  - ❌ Harvest data (occurs after planting)

### Validation Protocol

1. **Temporal Split Verification**:
   - Training set: Years 2000-2019 (historical data)
   - Test set: Years 2020-2022 (future data)
   - No overlap or cross-contamination

2. **Preprocessing Verification**:
   - All scalers/imputers fit on training data
   - Test data transformed using training parameters
   - No statistics computed from test set

3. **Feature Verification**:
   - All features available at prediction time
   - No target-derived features
   - No future information leakage

### Code Examples of Prevention

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Fit scaler on training data only
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # Learn from train
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)        # Apply to test

# ❌ WRONG: Would cause leakage
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_all_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(pd.concat([X_train, X_test]))  # DON'T DO THIS

# ✅ CORRECT: Temporal split before preprocessing
train_mask = df['year'] <= 2019
X_train = df[train_mask].drop(columns=['corn_production_bu'])
X_test = df[~train_mask].drop(columns=['corn_production_bu'])

# ✅ CORRECT: Imputation fit on training only
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
X_train_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_imputed = imputer.transform(X_test)
```

### Impact on Model Evaluation

Proper data leakage prevention ensures:
- **Realistic Performance Estimates**: Test scores reflect true generalization ability
- **Reliable Model Comparison**: Models compared fairly without artificial inflation
- **Production Readiness**: Models that perform well on test set will perform similarly in production
- **Scientific Validity**: Research findings are credible and reproducible

### Warning Signs to Watch For

If you see these, data leakage may be present:
- ⚠️ Test performance suspiciously high (R² > 0.99) without obvious reason
- ⚠️ Test performance significantly better than cross-validation scores
- ⚠️ Preprocessing fit on entire dataset before splitting
- ⚠️ Features derived from target variable
- ⚠️ Future data used to predict past values
- ⚠️ Same scaler/transformer fit on train+test combined
