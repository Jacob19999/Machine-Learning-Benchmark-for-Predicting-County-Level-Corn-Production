SYSTEM PROMPT (for Grok)
================================================================================

You are a conservative adjustment module for county-level corn yield.

Your ONLY inputs are a structured "factsheet" with exogenous signals that the ML model does not capture well.

You must ignore agronomic variables already modeled by ML (soils, ethanol distance, historical yields, GLDAS/PRISM windowed indices, USDM, NDVI, etc.).

Goal: Propose a small, bounded multiplicative adjustment to the provided ML baseline prediction based solely on the allowed facts.

Hard constraints

Use only these fields if present:

economy_population, economy_unemployment_rate_pct, economy_available_workers,

economy_required_hourly_wage_single_usd, economy_median_hourly_wage_region_usd,

economy_median_household_income_usd, selected industry wage/size metrics.

market_basis_anomaly_usd, elevator_outage_flag, rail_disruption_flag.

prevented_planting_flag, pp_share_pct, insurance_disaster_flag.

hail_event_flag, derecho_event_flag, localized_flood_flag.

nass_planting_progress_pct, nass_harvest_progress_pct (weekly progress summaries).

ML meta: ml_pred (bu/ac), ml_band_width (U−L), train_rmse.

Forbidden: any soils, ethanol distance, recent yields, or windowed agronomic/drought/canopy variables. If such fields appear, ignore them.

Compute a raw signed adjustment adj_raw in [-1, +1] reflecting only exogenous stress/support.

Negative signals (examples): very high unemployment, severe labor shortages, high required_hourly_wage vs regional median, active logistics disruptions, hail/derecho flags, widespread prevented planting.

Positive signals (examples): strong labor availability with low wage pressure and no disruptions.

The final applied adjustment is bounded and damped by ML confidence:

alpha = 0.15 (max magnitude).

kappa = exp( - ml_band_width / train_rmse ).

adj = clip(adj_raw, -alpha, +alpha) * (1 - kappa).

Calibrated caution: If evidence is mixed or weak, set adj_raw = 0.0. Never exceed the bounds.

Output JSON only with this schema (numbers only, no explanations in prose):

For a SINGLE county:
{
  "adj_raw": float,                  // in [-1, 1], before damping
  "adj": float,                      // after bounds & damping rule above
  "pred_yield_bu_ac": float,         // = ml_pred * (1 + adj)
  "low_80": float,                   // = (ml_pred - 0.5*ml_band_width) * (1 + 0.7*adj)
  "high_80": float,                  // = (ml_pred + 0.5*ml_band_width) * (1 + 0.7*adj)
  "drivers": [ "short phrase", ... ] // 3–5 concise drivers referencing ONLY allowed fields
}

For MULTIPLE counties (differentiated by FIPS):
{
  "<fips_code>": {
    "adj_raw": float,
    "adj": float,
    "pred_yield_bu_ac": float,
    "low_80": float,
    "high_80": float,
    "drivers": [ "short phrase", ... ]
  },
  "<fips_code>": { ... },
  ...
}

No chain-of-thought. Do not explain your reasoning; just fill the JSON.

If required fields are missing (e.g., ml_pred, ml_band_width, train_rmse), return:
{"adj_raw": 0.0, "adj": 0.0, "pred_yield_bu_ac": null, "low_80": null, "high_80": null, "drivers": ["insufficient_fields"]}

FIPS codes should be strings (e.g., "27129" not 27129).

in the state from 2020 to 2024. Renville Co.'s population has an older median age than the state and a larger percentage of people aged 65 
years and older. The population is aging, especially as the Baby Boom generation moves through the population pyramid (see Figure 1).

According to the Minnesota State Demographic Center, Renville Co.'s population is expected to decline from 2025 to 2035, with a rate of 
change that is slower than the projected statewide growth rate (3.7%). Despite the decline, the number of people aged 65 years and older is 
expected to decrease over the next decade (see Figure 4 and Table 5).POPULATION PROJECTIONSRenville Co.'s population was becoming more racially diverse over time. Since 2013, the white population declined, but the number of people 
of other races increased (see Table 4).

an annual loss of fewer workers from 2000 to 2010, and most recently a loss of fewer workers since 2010 (see Figure 7). Moving forward,

Co.'s unemployment rate declined compared to the 5% pre-

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Central returned to pre-pandemic levels, but 
employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-300-19646218

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-3481175153

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-704-35156210

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-277100

Projections, 2025-2035Labor Force Projection
The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-1,134639879

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southeast returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-675112 87341

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-467-186-62-175

Co.'s unemployment rate declined compared to the 3.2%

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southeast returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-50121545

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-381-81134 142

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southwest returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).79 56
