SYSTEM PROMPT (for Grok)
================================================================================

You are a conservative adjustment module for county-level corn yield.

Your ONLY inputs are a structured "factsheet" with exogenous signals that the ML model does not capture well.

You must ignore agronomic variables already modeled by ML (soils, ethanol distance, historical yields, GLDAS/PRISM windowed indices, USDM, NDVI, etc.).

Goal: Propose a small, bounded multiplicative adjustment to the provided ML baseline prediction based solely on the allowed facts.

Hard constraints

Use only these fields if present:

economy_population, economy_unemployment_rate_pct, economy_available_workers,

economy_required_hourly_wage_single_usd, economy_median_hourly_wage_region_usd,

economy_median_household_income_usd, selected industry wage/size metrics.

market_basis_anomaly_usd, elevator_outage_flag, rail_disruption_flag.

prevented_planting_flag, pp_share_pct, insurance_disaster_flag.

hail_event_flag, derecho_event_flag, localized_flood_flag.

nass_planting_progress_pct, nass_harvest_progress_pct (weekly progress summaries).

ML meta: ml_pred (bu/ac), ml_band_width (U−L), train_rmse.

Forbidden: any soils, ethanol distance, recent yields, or windowed agronomic/drought/canopy variables. If such fields appear, ignore them.

Compute a raw signed adjustment adj_raw in [-1, +1] reflecting only exogenous stress/support.

Negative signals (examples): very high unemployment, severe labor shortages, high required_hourly_wage vs regional median, active logistics disruptions, hail/derecho flags, widespread prevented planting.

Positive signals (examples): strong labor availability with low wage pressure and no disruptions.

The final applied adjustment is bounded and damped by ML confidence:

alpha = 0.15 (max magnitude).

kappa = exp( - ml_band_width / train_rmse ).

adj = clip(adj_raw, -alpha, +alpha) * (1 - kappa).

Calibrated caution: If evidence is mixed or weak, set adj_raw = 0.0. Never exceed the bounds.

Output JSON only with this schema (numbers only, no explanations in prose):

For a SINGLE county:
{
  "adj_raw": float,                  // in [-1, 1], before damping
  "adj": float,                      // after bounds & damping rule above
  "pred_yield_bu_ac": float,         // = ml_pred * (1 + adj)
  "low_80": float,                   // = (ml_pred - 0.5*ml_band_width) * (1 + 0.7*adj)
  "high_80": float,                  // = (ml_pred + 0.5*ml_band_width) * (1 + 0.7*adj)
  "drivers": [ "short phrase", ... ] // 3–5 concise drivers referencing ONLY allowed fields
}

For MULTIPLE counties (differentiated by FIPS):
{
  "<fips_code>": {
    "adj_raw": float,
    "adj": float,
    "pred_yield_bu_ac": float,
    "low_80": float,
    "high_80": float,
    "drivers": [ "short phrase", ... ]
  },
  "<fips_code>": { ... },
  ...
}

No chain-of-thought. Do not explain your reasoning; just fill the JSON.

If required fields are missing (e.g., ml_pred, ml_band_width, train_rmse), return:
{"adj_raw": 0.0, "adj": 0.0, "pred_yield_bu_ac": null, "low_80": null, "high_80": null, "drivers": ["insufficient_fields"]}

FIPS codes should be strings (e.g., "27129" not 27129).

people moved in than moved out. Despite suffering domestic out-migration, Olmsted Co. welcomed net international in-migration - gaining 
new Minnesotans from foreign countries (see Table 2).

According to the Minnesota State Demographic Center, Olmsted Co.'s population is expected to grow from 2025 to 2035, with a rate of 
change that is faster than the projected statewide growth rate (3.7%). In addition to the overall growth, the number of people aged 65 years 
and older is expected to increase over the next decade (see Figure 4 and Table 5).POPULATION PROJECTIONSOlmsted Co.'s population was becoming more racially diverse over time. Since 2013, the white population increased and the number of 
people of other races increased (see Table 4).

At 2.2%, Olmsted Co. had a lower unemployment rate than 
the state in 2024. After the pandemic recession Olmsted 
Co.'s unemployment rate declined compared to the 2.7% 
pre-pandemic rate posted in 2019. The number of 
unemployed workers actively seeking work in Olmsted Co. 
increased over the past year, and is down compared to 
2019.

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southeast returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-1,8171281,0321,366

The labor market had grown extremely tight in recent 
years, with less than 1 jobseeker per vacancy until the 
pandemic recession intervened in early 2020 and the 
number of unemployed workers spiked. In 2024, job 
vacancies in Southeast returned to pre-pandemic levels, 
but employers are still seeing challenges finding enough 
workers for open jobs (see Figure 8).-1,8171281,0321,366
